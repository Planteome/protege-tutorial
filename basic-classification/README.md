This example extends the DL queries example and introduces "defined
classes" and automatic classification.

# Plant Example

 1. Check out plant-ontology from github
 2. Open plant-ontology.owl (or the obo if you have the latest protege) -- alternatively use po-slim.owl in this directory
 3. Start hermit
 4. Do a DL query for ('plant organ' and 'part of' some flower)
 5. Do you see stamen in the results?
 6. Add an equivalence axiom for 'floral organ' to the same expression as the query in 4
 7. synchronize the reasoner
 8. navigate to stamen
 9. Click on the '?' to see why stamen is placed under floral organ
